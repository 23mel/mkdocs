## Software
This page will be touching on how to setup the lidar as well as the programs used to operate the lidar. (Metaview & Ritz)

### Physical Setup
- Take note that everytime you connect the lidar to the Aruvii laptop, you will have to switch the connection settings to LiDAR as the default selection is relay. The lidar will not show any output if not done so.

### Metaview
This is used to look at what the LiDAR can see as well as control the location of the [ROI](pre-read.md). 

There are 2 methods when it comes to configuring the ROI; one for controlling its particular position (centroid), the other for adjusting its parameters. 

### Ritz
Ritz is a 3d simulation that produces the LiDAR output over your current location. With Ritz, you can see the detection and tracking of drones, as well as configure lidar parameters to refine the detection output (known as rqt_reconfigure).

update with more pictures & notes later on: 
- pictures of physical setup
- screenshot the connection settings in the laptop 
- screenshots for ROI in metaview, rqt_reconfigure, virtual zone in ritz & detection outputs(green boxes)
- video of drone getting detected (can use the videos i took when we were testing in office)
- (kiv) can add in Raj's notes for better understanding, or redraw the illustrations for better clarity.
