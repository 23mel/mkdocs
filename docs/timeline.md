## Timeline

This is the order of tasks/events that I went through during my time working as an intern. Keep in mind that your experience could be different down the road.

- Ethernet relay board: around 1.5 or 2 weeks.  
- Learning ROS: took about 2-3 weeks.  
- GNSS: 2-3 weeks  
- IMU: few days to a week.  
- SBC: 2 weeks 

And as for learning how to set up and operate the lidar, it was through constant learning throughout the internship that made me familiar with it.
