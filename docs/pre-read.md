### CAUS sensors and solutions 

CAUS (Counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems) purpose is to prevent nefarious or unauthorised drones from disrupting places. Counter-drone solutions are to identify, track and mitigate threats, providing airspace security. 

##### Types of CAUS sensors:
- Radar
- RF (Radio Frequency) Analysers
- Accoustic
- Optical

Some CAUS technologies only use one type of sensor. Others can also opt to include a method of mitigation like jamming, takeover or kinetic mitigation.
