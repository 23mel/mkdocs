## Introduction
(What GNSS stands for and how it works)

## Setting up
We will be using ROS to handle the GNSS. Take note that the GNSS will most likely be unable to connect to your computer as it runs on a different version of WSL. Hence, it would be recommended to configure/run the GNSS on the Aruvii laptop.
