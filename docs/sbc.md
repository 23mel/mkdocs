## Setting up
- Follow the default setup procedure for the RPI4 - connect it to an external monitor, mouse and keyboard. 
- The SD card should already be flashed with an OS. (Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop) If not, use Imager to install the OS in the SD card.
- Code will need to be written to handle the IMU serial data. You can try writing the code using the source code from the IMU documentation first.
