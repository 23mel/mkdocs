## Tasks
Try these after going through [ROS tutorials](ros-tutorials.md).

1) Basic Chat Program
- Should have two separate ROS Nodes
- Message typed in one Node should be displayed in the other Node
- Messages should go through ROS
- Messages should be visible via `rostopic echo`
- Be able to record via `rosbag` the messages being sent and received

2) Further Features (Optional)
- Configurable topic names via Parameter server
- Config file as `.yaml` file
- Add a bot node that sends a message every X seconds
- Use a `.launch` file to start multiple nodes at once

Even though implementing parameter and launch file are optional, you should at least have an understanding on how those concepts work.
